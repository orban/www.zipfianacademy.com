title: The Data Science Mindset
---
Data scientists use lots of hip tools with sexy names like "R" and "Python",
but data science isn't all about the tools you use. To us, data science is a mindset:
a way of looking at the world. It's about taking advantage of our modern
computers and all of the information (aka data) that they're already collecting
in order to study how things work. If we start with this mindset, a lot of
data science approaches naturally follow.

These are the core tenets of the data science mindset:

## Store Everything
Storage is cheap, so you should store everything that is easy to collect.
You don't even need a full-fledged research plan before you start collecting data.
Store it in the rawest form that is convenient, and don't worry very
much about how or even whether you're going to analyzes it. That part comes later.

### Use Existing Data
Since we're already storing data, let's use it.
When faced with a question about something happening in the world, data scientists adapt the question 
so that it can be approximately answered with an existing and convenient dataset. The most fun part
is when you can use existing stores of data in unintended ways. For example, there is a plethora 
of satellite imagery of earth. We could use this data to learn about [fertilizer use in Uganda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ajFogCaRbs),
or use pictures of the earth at night to estimate [rural electrification](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~brianmin/MinEtAl_Detection_IJRS_2013.pdf)
in developing countries.

### Connect Datasets
Since you're storing everything, you should focus on connecting datasets that already exist rather
than on tuning models. Conventional statistics teaches a lot about how to choose
analysis methods that are appropriate for your data collection approach and how
to tune the models for a specific dataset.

Now that we suddenly have hoards of inexpensive data in the world in ways we never have before,
there's a lot to be learned by utilizing more of these data. Don't worry so much
about making the best use out of one dataset. Data science is about using a range of
datasets, and especially about connecting one dataset to lots of other datasets. In machine learning speak, it's better
to focus on on collecting features rather than on tuning your model.

## Anything Can Be Quantified
Everything can be turned into a number, and these numbers can be put in tables.
By putting things in terms of numbers, we simplify them such that a computer can process them.

A [spreadsheet about sewer overflows](https://data.illinois.gov/Municipality/SSMMA-Combined-Sewer-Overflow/5yuf-j7kn?)
is clearly data to most people, but what about a [calendar](http://www.mo.gov/meetings/)?
At first, a calendar might not seem like the sort of data that you analyze with statistics. However, you
could also represent a calendar as a [spreadsheet](https://data.mo.gov/Government-Administration/Open-Meetings/au6r-w9n3)
and [as a graph](http://thomaslevine.com/!/socrata-calendars). Then it's data.

The creative part of data science is moving past the obvious variables that are presented to you in the data 
you're looking at. Maybe you have a bunch of PDF documents. You could easily extract the text in the
PDFs and search through that data. However, there's other data you can get here that could be interesting, 
depending on the problem you're solving. Without looking at the text at all, you can get the page count,
the file size, and the shapes of the pages and the [program that created it](http://thomaslevine.com/!/parsing-pdfs/).
There's information hidden in lots of datasets that goes beyond what's immediately obvious.

There's lots of talk about the difference between different kinds of data. There's "qualitative" vs.
"quantitative" and "unstructured" vs. "structured." 
To me, there is no big difference between "qualitative" and "quantitative" data
nor between "unstructured" and "structured" data because I know that I can convert
between the different types.

At first, the registration papers of company might not seem like data. They begin as paper,
most of their fields are text, and their formats aren't particularly standardized.
But when you put them in [one database](http://opencorporates.com/) in a standard format,
things start to [feel a whole lot like data](http://registries.opencorporates.com/). 
This means qualitative data becomes quantatitive data, and it's all really just...data.

## Send Boring Work to Robots
If something must be done and nobody wants to do it, we should get a robot to
do it. Within the context of data analysis, a typical boring task might be drawing a new graph every time some
dataset is updated. A robot will do this with substantially more
consistency and accuracy than a human and at a substantially lower cost.

Data collection is one sort of task that should regularly be sent to a robot. Questionnaires
and lab studies are too much work for the researcher and the participants involved. The data science mindset 
says collect the data automatically and unobtrusively,
like by logging the clicks that you're already making on a website.

Robots are particularly good at remembering what you did so that you don't have to do so. Rather than learning
and remembering your entire analysis process, you can write a program that does the whole
thing for you, from the original acquisition of the data, to the modeling, to the presentation
of results to another person. By making everything a program, you make it easier to
find mistakes, to update your analyses, and to turn an analysis into a product.

## Tools
Once you're inside the data science mindset, it only makes sense to acquire skills that align with that 
mindset and help solve interesting problems. Storage and analysis tools mean you can 
collect lots of data continuously, store it, and then get it back out of
storage. You can tell a computer to fit models and make predictions about datasets that are too big to wrap your
head around, convert paper documents into electronic tables, get the computer to tell
you something easy to understand, and how to make all of the computer processes run
fast enough so that it doesn't take all day.

Properly discussing these relevant tools is another post (maybe a book), but here's one
thought: you don't need to know much math to do data science. Loads of wonderful
algorithms have already been implemented for you, and simple algorithms often work quite
well. The trickier tools to master are the "plumbing" that connects different datasets and systems.

## Data Science Mindset at Zipfian Academy
The data science mindset and the tools work hand-in-hand. Mastering both is key to being a great data scientist.
That's why we're excited about teaching the data science mindset, just like we teach the problem-solving tools.
In our 12-week course, we organize classes by projects - like a recommendation engine or a spam filter - rather than
by software packages or algorithms. Starting with a question or problem, we look at different programs,
datasets, and methods to use, plus the plumbing to connect the different components together. It's a data scientist's
pratical mindset applied to learning.
